                <summary><b> Process insights tool: RECIPE SCALING</b></summary>
                <i> Customer: </i> <span> A UK company </span><br>
                <i> Project description: </i> <span> Our team worked on a process insights tool that allowed
                    recipe scaling. The tool helped express a scaling problem in terms of
                    the biological, operational, and organizational constraints, including the dynamics
                    of a culture. The solution also helped predict the outcomes of the processes by
                    simulating the processes in silico. The tool allowed identifying and correcting
                    errors, analyzing how favorable the outcomes of the processes were, and
                    optimizing the processes for some operational goals.
                    Our team of 18 experts completed the following tasks:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Developed user-friendly visualization and all the required functionality linked
                            to the calculation algorithm.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Covered an end-to-end user flow.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developed a scaling calculation engine.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
