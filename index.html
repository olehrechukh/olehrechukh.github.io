                    <span class="justify-text"> Our team worked on a process insights tool that allowed
                        recipe scaling. The tool helped express a scaling problem in terms of
                        the biological, operational, and organizational constraints, including the dynamics
                        of a culture. The solution also helped predict the outcomes of the processes by
                        simulating the processes in silico. The tool allowed identifying and correcting
                        errors, analyzing how favorable the outcomes of the processes were, and
                        optimizing the processes for some operational goals.

                        The project featured a point-scaling solution that helped scale cell culture processes up and
                        down,
                        from small bioreactors (starting at 15 ml) to large bioreactors (up to 2,000 l).
                        The solution helped determine in silico whether the process was scalable and could be

                        from process development to manufacturing bioreactors.
